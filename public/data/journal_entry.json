      "content": "The initial implementation of the Chaos Map was rendering too many DOM nodes. By switching the Plotly configuration to use WebGL contexts for the scatter plot, we reduced the rendering overhead by 40% on mobile devices. It's a classic reminder that visualization libraries often default to SVG, which doesn't scale well beyond a few thousand points."

The AWS Lambda triggers were firing correctly, but the Snowflake warehouse resume time was adding about 45 seconds of cold-start latency. I've adjusted the warehouse auto-suspend policy to stay warm during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST)."
