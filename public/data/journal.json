      "content": "Most financial dashboards are high-bandwidth noise. They excel at showing *what* happened (a 5% dip, a volatility spike), but they fail to explain *why*. I wanted to build a system that delivers context alongside calculation, effectively treating narrative as a data point.\nI designed a polyglot architecture to handle this, rather than forcing a single model to do the heavy lifting. I used OpenAI to generate vector embeddings that group news stories into spatial 'islands' based on meaning. Meanwhile, Snowflake Cortex runs directly inside my dbt models to score sentiment in real-time, and Llama 3 acts as the on-demand analyst to synthesize the noise into executive summaries.\nThis structure proves that AI isn't magic; it's simply the newest transformation layer in the stack. We used to aggregate numbers. Now, by orchestrating specialized tools for specialized layers, we can aggregate meaning."
